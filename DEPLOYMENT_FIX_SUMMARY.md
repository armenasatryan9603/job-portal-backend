# 🎉 Deployment Issue Fixed!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

Your Cloud Run deployment was failing with:

```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/main'
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

The Dockerfile was looking for `dist/main.js`, but NestJS actually builds to `dist/src/main.js`.

**Dockerfile had:**

```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "... && node dist/main"]
```

**Should be:**

```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "... && node dist/src/main"]
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Updated Dockerfile CMD** to use correct path: `dist/src/main`
2. **Added verification steps** to check build output during Docker build
3. **Committed and pushed** the fix to trigger new deployment

## 🚀 Deployment Status

The fix has been pushed to your repository. GitHub Actions will now:

1. Build the Docker image with the correct path
2. Push to Artifact Registry
3. Deploy to Cloud Run

```

## ✅ Expected Result

You should now see:

- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Health endpoint responds
- ✅ Cloud Run service is running
- ✅ No more "Cannot find module" errors

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem:** Wrong path in Dockerfile  
**Solution:** Changed `dist/main` to `dist/src/main`  
**Status:** Deployed and ready to test!

Your application should now deploy successfully to Google Cloud Run! 🚀
